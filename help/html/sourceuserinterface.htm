<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr valign="top"><td align="left">
<p>When the application desires to acquire images from the image device, the Source's user interface (UI) is usually shown. &nbsp;Some UI's can be very simple, while others may have a myriad of controls, buttons, preview scanning areas, etc. &nbsp;The UI is usually displayed during TWAIN <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return hmshowPopup(event, popid_1530542323X, true);" class="popuplink">State 5</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>When the Source displays the UI, the UI is usually implemented as a modal or modeless dialog box, or a multiple set of modal / modeless dialogs.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source UI as a modal dialog:</span></p>
<p>If the Source is implemented as a modal dialog box, the application cannot perform any other actions until the UI is closed (except of course for interacting with the Source UI and starting the image acquisition). &nbsp;The Source is automatically closed by DTWAIN after an acquisition is done (remember that an acquisition may consist of retrieving multiple pages).</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source UI as a modeless dialog (or a set of modeless windows):</span></p>
<p>If the Source UI is implemented as a modeless dialog, the user can perform any application action while the Source UI is opened. &nbsp;The Source UI can remain open until the user decides to close it. &nbsp;The Source UI should only be closed by the user, and not be closed by the application unless the application is terminating. &nbsp;However, this is only a good guideline to follow (TWAIN has stated that this should be the way an application handle a modeless UI). &nbsp;DTWAIN allows you to override this behavior for modeless dialog boxes by calling <a href="dtwain_closesource.htm">DTWAIN_CloseSource</a>, <a href="dtwain_endtwainsession.htm">DTWAIN_EndTwainSession</a>, <a href="dtwain_sysdestroy.htm">DTWAIN_SysDestroy</a>, or <a href="dtwain_setmaxacquisitions.htm">DTWAIN_SetMaxAcquisitions</a>. &nbsp;These functions can be called to close a Source, a TWAIN session, or close the entire DTWAIN DLL mechanism, respectively. &nbsp;Care must be taken that these functions are not called while an image is being acquired, i.e. the scanner is not 'in motion' when closing the Source. &nbsp;The DTWAIN Source State functions help out in this regard.</p>
