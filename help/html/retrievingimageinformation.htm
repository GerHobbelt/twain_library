<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr valign="top"><td align="left">
<p>For many reasons, an application may desire to check the size, bit-depth, etc. of an image before it is acquired. &nbsp;To do this the function to call is <a href="dtwain_getimageinfo.htm">DTWAIN_GetImageInfo</a>. &nbsp;Note that this function is only relevant if your application is processing <a href="dtwain_notification_codes.htm">DTWAIN notifications</a> since the TWAIN driver can only know the image dimensions and other information during the acquisition process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To call DTWAIN_GetImageInfo correctly, your application should process the DTWAIN_TN_TRANSFERREADY and DTWAIN_TN_PROCESSEDDIB notifications and call DTWAIN_GetImageInfo when these notifications are sent. &nbsp;For most TWAIN devices, the DTWAIN_TN_TRANSFERREADY notification is all that's necessary to retrieve the image information. &nbsp;This allows your application to inspect the dimensions, bit-depth, etc. of the image, and accept or reject the image transfer based on the parameters. &nbsp;To stop the transfer of an image, your application must return a 0 after processing the DTWAIN_TN_TRANSFERREADY notification. &nbsp;See DTWAIN Notifications for more information on the DTWAIN_TN_TRANSFERREADY notifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some TWAIN drivers that do not report the image information correctly when the transfer begins. &nbsp;For these devices, the image information is valid after the transfer has taken place. &nbsp;Usually, these devices are hand-held scanners, or devices that determine the image dimensions after the acquisition has taken place (some scanners use a mode where the scanner scans the image, and then from the scanned image, determines the size of the image by the size of the paper in the scanner). &nbsp;For these devices, your application should process the DTWAIN_PROCESSEDDIB or DTWAIN_TRANSFERDONE notification. &nbsp;You can tell if the device is one that determines the image size after the acquisition has been done by calling DTWAIN_GetImageInfo during DTWAIN_TRANSFERREADY processing and checking for a -1 value for the width and height of the image. &nbsp;A value of -1 means that the call to DTWAIN_GetImageInfo couldn't retrieve the image information.</p>
