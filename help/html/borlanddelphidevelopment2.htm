<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please note: &nbsp;Late breaking news as of the writing of this manual is Delphi now supports 64-bit applications. &nbsp; For 64-bit applications, DTWAIN64.DLL is used, as well as DTWAIN64.PAS is used as the interface file instead of DTWAIN32.PAS. &nbsp;In the information below, any reference to DTWAIN32.DLL and DTWAIN32.PAS pertains to DTWAIN64.DLL and DTWAIN64.PAS, respectively.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DTWAIN32 DLL is a standard 32-bit Windows Dynamic Link that exposes its functionality using the "stdcall" calling convention. &nbsp; Currently DTWAIN is not a true Delphi component, but only a Dynamic Link Library. &nbsp;Included in the DTWAIN installation is a Delphi interface file <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTWAIN32.PAS</span>. &nbsp;All you need to do is include this file in your Delphi application, and in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">uses</span> clause in the interface section, specify <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTWAIN32</span>.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since DTWAIN has 64-bit types, the DTWAIN32.PAS file is compatible with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delphi 4</span> and above. &nbsp;Earlier versions of Delphi did not have 64-bit integer types, therefore if you're using an earlier version of Delphi, you will need to use the DTWAIN32_PRE4.PAS file.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The DTWAIN32.DLL must be installed either in your application's directory, or in a directory that is specified in your system's <span style="font-weight: bold;">PATH</span> environment variable.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There are example Delphi programs that demonstrate how to use DTWAIN. &nbsp;The programs are very simple, and are meant to illustrate how to get started with various aspects of TWAIN. &nbsp;All of the demo programs should compile with Delphi 4 or higher. &nbsp;The only demo program that will not compile for Delphi 3 and below is CAPINFO, as this demo uses features of Delphi that exist only in version 4 and above.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Delphi supports callback functions, so you can monitor the progress of a TWAIN acquisition using <a href="processing_acquisition_message.htm">notifications</a> using Delphi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0504d;">As of this writing of the manual, only an ANSI version of the Delphi interface file is available. &nbsp;This means that DTWAIN32.DLL and DTWAIN64.DLL will work correctly for Delphi applications, therefore it is recommended that you to use DTWAIN32.DLL or DTWAIN64.DLL.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0504d;">If you wish to use the Unicode version of DTWAIN (DTWAIN32U.DLL or DTWAIN64U.DLL), you will need to change the definitions in the *.PAS files to ensure that the strings are passed and received correctly from the Unicode DTWAIN functions to your Delphi program.</span></p>
