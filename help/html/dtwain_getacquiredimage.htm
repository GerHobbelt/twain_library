<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span></p>
<p>If <a href="dtwain_acquirenative.htm">DTWAIN_AcquireNative</a> or <a href="dtwain_acquirebuffered.htm">DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered</a> is called, you will need to get the images that were created for the pages that were acquired. &nbsp;The returned value from DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage is the image that was generated for the acquisition attempt <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichAcquire </span>and for page <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichImage</span>. &nbsp;For most acquisitions the returned handle describes a Device Independent Bitmap (DIB). &nbsp;If DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered is called and DTWAIN_GetCompressionType is not DTWAIN_CP_NONE, the returned memory is raw, uncompressed data. &nbsp;Regardless of whether a DIB or an uncompressed image is returned, DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage is used for both types.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">AcqArray</span> argument is the DTWAIN_ARRAY that was returned when DTWAIN_AcquireNative or DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered was called. &nbsp; Remember that these acquisition functions return an array denoting the acquisitions and the array of images within each acquisition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The next argument <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichAcquire</span> denotes the acquisition number. &nbsp;The reason for the acquisition number is that the user may have started the acquisition process multiple times before actually closing the <a href="sourceuserinterface.htm">Source UI</a>.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since it is possible (and most likely) that a Source will be implemented as a modeless dialog, a user may attempt to acquire images many times before actually closing the UI. &nbsp;Each time the user requests to acquire images using the Source UI, a brand new set of images are generated. &nbsp;DTWAIN does not replace any previously acquired images; instead DTWAIN saves them in an array.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The acquisition number denotes the set of images generated for an acquisition started by the user. &nbsp;The acquisition number starts at 0, and is increased by 1 each time the user selects to acquire an image during a single call to each of the DTWAIN Acquisition functions. &nbsp;When the user or the program closes the Source UI, any subsequent call to a DTWAIN Acquisition function will start the acquisition number back to 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last argument, <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichImage</span> denotes which image within the acquisition to retrieve. &nbsp;This is the image that is returned from DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage. &nbsp;This argument starts at 0 and has a limit to the number of acquired images within the acquisition minus one.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Using DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage for Modal TWAIN Acquisition Processing</span></p>
<p>If the application decides to use <a href="dtwain_modal_acquisition_proc.htm">Modal TWAIN acquisition processing</a>, the following two scenarios illustrate the point of using DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Scenario 1:</p>
<p>A document scanner that will acquire images is equipped with an automatic document feeder (ADF). &nbsp;The user has placed five pages in the feeder and desires to scan all of the pages. &nbsp;Your application will call DTWAIN_AcquireNative to acquire all of the pages. &nbsp;Since the feeder contains five pages, there will be five images generated, one image per page. &nbsp;The TWAIN Source UI for the scanner is implemented as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">modal dialog</span>, which means that the Source UI will be closed automatically by DTWAIN whenever the acquisition has been completed.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Your application calls DTWAIN_AcquireNative, which initially displays the Source's user interface. &nbsp;The user then initiates the acquisition from the Source UI, which then scans all five pages. &nbsp;The Source UI is closed automatically by DTWAIN and DTWAIN_AcquireNative returns with the DTWAIN_ARRAY. &nbsp;There has been one acquisition, with five images existing for the acquisition. &nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichAcquire</span> value for the DTWAIN_ARRAY is 0 (the first acquisition), and the images are numbered from 0 to 4 (pages 1 through 5).  </p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Scenario 2:</p>
<p>The scanner that will be used to acquire an image is equipped with an automatic document feeder (ADF). &nbsp;The user has initially placed three pages in the feeder and desires to scan all of the pages. &nbsp;Your application will call DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered to acquire all of the pages. &nbsp;Since the feeder contains three pages, there will be three images generated, one image per page. &nbsp;The TWAIN Source UI for the scanner is implemented as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">modeless dialog</span>, which means that the Source UI will not be closed automatically by DTWAIN whenever the acquisition has been completed. &nbsp;The only entity that will close the Source UI is the user (there are ways to force closure of the Source UI programmatically; this topic explains more).</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Your application calls DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered, which initially displays the Source's UI. &nbsp;The user then initiates the acquisition from the Source UI, which then scans all three pages. &nbsp;The Source UI remains opened. &nbsp;The user now places ten pages in the feeder and again initiates another acquisition. &nbsp;Again all ten pages are scanned successfully. &nbsp;The user decides to close the Source UI and DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered finally returns. &nbsp;There have been two acquisitions, the first acquired three pages, and the second acquired ten pages. &nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichAcquire </span>can be either 1 (the first acquisition) or 2 (the second acquisition). &nbsp;Since the first acquisition generated three pages <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichImage</span> can range from 1 to 3. &nbsp;Similarly, the second acquisition generated ten pages, so <span style="font-style: italic;">WhichImage</span> can range from 1 to 10.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Using DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage for Modeless TWAIN Acquisition Processing</span></p>
<p>If the application decides to use <a href="dtwain_modeless_acquisition_p.htm">Modeless TWAIN acquisition processing</a>, the <a href="dtwain_getacquiredimage.htm">DTWAIN_GetAcquiredImage</a> function returns the last set of successful images that were acquired. &nbsp;The modeless model does not 'store' all of the acquisition information as the Modal model does.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span></p>
<p>With each subsequent call to DTWAIN_AcquireBuffered or DTWAIN_AcquireNative, the acquisition count is reset to zero 0.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span></p>
<p>If you want to limit the number of acquisition attempts, use the <a href="dtwain_setmaxacquisitions.htm">DTWAIN_SetMaxAcquisitions</a> function.</p>
